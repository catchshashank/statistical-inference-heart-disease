# Applied Statistical Inference in Python  
## Hypothesis Testing and Experimental Design using Heart Disease Data

This repository implements core statistical inference techniques in Python, using both real-world medical data and simulated experiments.

## Methods Implemented

- One-sample t-test
- Inference on population variance (Chi-square test)
- Chi-square test for independence
- Goodness-of-fit test
- One-way ANOVA
- 2x3 Factorial experimental design

## Dataset

Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Tools Used

- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- ucimlrepo

## Key Features

- Clean implementation of classical hypothesis testing
- Visualization of sampling distributions
- Real data + simulated experiment comparison
- Structured experimental workflow

## Why This Project

This project demonstrates foundational statistical inference skills underlying machine learning and econometric modeling.

Understanding classical inference is essential for:
- Model validation
- Experimental design
- Causal analysis
- Business decision-making
